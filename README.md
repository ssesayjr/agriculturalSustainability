The initial question posed for the Analytic report and Research Proposal Capstone is to determine if smallholder agricultural farmers, businesses, and entrepreneurships are lucrative and sustainable in Sierra Leone, Senegal, Guinea-Bisaau and/or Guinea. The question stems from US Government Agencies, International Development sector, and Non-Government Organizations redirecting and focusing funds into the agricultural sector of developing countries. There is the logical assumption that developing countries need a sustainable and growing agricultural market; however, in the United States, 2 percent of the population are farmers but feed upwards to 330 million people annually (source: American Farm Bureau Federation).  Based on this assumption, a smaller percentage of farmers would be able to sustain either of the four countries. By analyzing the growth of the agricultural sector in four Western African countries and the effect on the country's Gross Domestic Product this capstone will determine which West African Country would be best for an agricultural smallholder farmer, business or entrepreneurs.
